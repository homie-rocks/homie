# @homie-rocks/studio

A studio for games, music and video on its own Cloudflare. One repository (`AGENTS.md`,
`games/`, `music/`, `videos/`, `posts/`, `site/`), multiplayer games on the Homie netplay
contract (every browser renders, strangers meet in public rooms, bots fill seats, rounds
restart), and a site Worker with Table/Lobby Durable Objects and D1 that the studio deploys
to its own Cloudflare account with Wrangler. The homie.rocks directory lists the games.

Most people never run this by hand: the Homie plugin for Claude Code and Codex does,
and the person approves Cloudflare once in their browser.

```sh
npx -y --package=https://homie.rocks/npm/homie-studio-0.5.0.tgz homie-studio new ./night-owls --name "Night Owls"
cd night-owls && npm install
npx homie-studio game new crown-thief --from gem-rush --name "Crown Thief"
npx homie-studio dev                                   # the whole site locally
npx homie-studio check crown-thief --url http://127.0.0.1:8787
npx homie-studio deploy --plan                         # what deploy will create, and what it costs; changes nothing
npx homie-studio deploy                                # the studio's own Cloudflare
npx homie-studio publish                               # the homie.rocks directory
```

## No payment method needed

`deploy` creates only what Cloudflare's free Workers plan gives a new account with no
payment method: one Worker, one D1 database and two SQLite-backed Durable Objects
(`Table`, `Lobby`). It never creates or binds R2. A brand-new Cloudflare account verifies
its email address before it can run a Worker; a missing `workers.dev` subdomain is
registered by Wrangler when Claude Code or Codex runs the deploy.

Storage for large media (songs, videos, big art) is a separate, optional step:

```sh
npx homie-studio storage add                           # an R2 bucket, bound as MEDIA, served at /media/<key>
npx homie-studio deploy
npx homie-studio media put music/theme.wav
```

Cloudflare asks for a payment method on the account before R2 works, even inside R2's free
tier (10 GB-month of storage, 1 million writes and 10 million reads a month), so `storage add`
refuses with the dashboard link until the account has R2 turned on, and creates nothing.
The free plan's daily limits (100,000 Worker requests; D1 5 million rows read and 100,000
written) reset at 00:00 UTC; past them requests fail until the reset and nothing is charged.

An existing single-player web game becomes a multiplayer one with the port toolkit
(the plugin's `port` skill drives it):

```sh
npx homie-studio port plan ../my-game                  # grade it: easy, medium, hard or not a fit, and why
npx homie-studio port import ../my-game --id my-game   # bring it into games/ (static, bundle or its own build)
npx homie-studio port check my-game --url http://127.0.0.1:8787   # the owner tests, real touch, host kill, late joiner, a round
```

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/homie-studio.mjs` | The CLI. |
| `lib/scaffold.mjs` | `new`: the studio monorepo, only into a new or empty folder, every file listed. |
| `lib/build.mjs` | `build`: games bundled with esbuild into `site/dist`, `games.json`, each game's shared `source.json`. |
| `lib/cloudflare.mjs` | `deploy` (and `deploy --plan`): Wrangler, D1, migrations, the directory claim; refuses resources it did not create. `storage add`: the optional R2 bucket. |
| `lib/check.mjs` | `check`: two fresh Chrome processes (computer + phone) must share a room and finish a round. |
| `lib/port.mjs` | `port plan` (reads a game and grades the port) and `port import`. |
| `lib/port-check.mjs` | `port check`: held and alternating directions on keys, Android Chrome and iPhone WebKit touch, UI cover, two browsers finishing a round, a killed host, a late joiner, the big screen. |
| `port/` | The port toolkit (`@homie-rocks/studio/port`, or `window.HomiePort` from `homie-port.js` in a static game): `createRoom`, the touch kit, keys, camera rules, bots, a HUD, sandbox shims, first-touch audio, `exposePort`. |
| `worker/index.mjs` | The site Worker and the `Table` (netplay relay, `room.mjs`) and `Lobby` Durable Objects; `/<game>/tv` is the big screen with a join QR (`qr.mjs`); `/music/<slug>/` and `/videos/<slug>/` are song and video pages (their files served with byte ranges, from the site or from storage at `/media/<key>`). |
| `lib/media.mjs`, `media/MEDIA.md` | The `music/` and `videos/` manifests: which entries get a page, and where each file's bytes come from (the site itself up to 25 MiB a file, the studio's storage, or a link). `media list` shows it; `media put` uploads a file to storage and records its key. |
| `netplay/` | The netplay contract (`NETPLAY.md`) and its game helper (`@homie-rocks/studio/netplay`). |
| `starters/gem-rush/` | The reference multiplayer starter. |

Versions are immutable: a published version never changes, so a studio that pinned one
never changes by surprise. A change ships as a new `version`, on the npm registry as
`@homie-rocks/studio` and as a tarball at `https://homie.rocks/npm/homie-studio-<version>.tgz`
(which is what `homie-studio new` pins).
