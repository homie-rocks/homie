description: Make an existing single-player web game multiplayer in a Homie studio. Reads the game (loop, input, state, camera), grades the port easy, medium, hard or not a fit and says why, adds netplay public rooms (bots in empty seats, join in progress, server rules, predicted movement, rounds), phone touch controls, a stable camera and the big-screen view, proves it with the owner tests (held and alternating directions, real touch on iPhone WebKit and Android Chrome, a late joiner, a departing first player, two fresh browsers finishing a round), then publishes only when requested. Use when someone says "make this multiplayer", "make my game multiplayer on Homie", "port this game to my studio", or points at a single-player web game.

# Make a game multiplayer (port)

A port is done when strangers who press Play land in the same live room, each
browser renders the game itself, bots fill the empty seats, rounds end and restart,
the controls mean the same thing every second on a phone and a computer, and the
checks below pass on the live site. Take as long as it needs; quality is the bar,
not speed. Never call it done on a guess: the checks say, or you say plainly what
still fails.

The person should not have to type anything after asking. Find what you need,
decide, and keep going. Stop only for something only they can give: the one
Cloudflare approval, a licence question, or a game that is not a fit.

**Finish in this turn.** A port takes a long time; stay with it until it is live and
checked. Never end your turn, schedule a wake-up, or hand back "it is running" while
a check, a build or a deploy is still going: wait for it by polling (a short `sleep`
then `tail` of its log, repeated) and keep working. When your turn ends, the
processes you started (the dev server, a running check) end with it, and a
half-ported game is left behind.

## 0. Find the game and the studio

- **The game** is the folder they named, or the current folder if it holds an
  `index.html`. Otherwise look one level down for the only folder with one.
- **The studio** is the folder with `studio.json`: here or above, else next to the
  game (`find .. -maxdepth 2 -name studio.json`). One found: use it. None: set one
  up first with the `studio-setup` skill (name it after the person's game), then
  come back. Several: use the one the person named, or ask which.
- **The toolkit.** In the studio, `npx --no-install homie-studio port plan <game>`
  must work. If it says unknown command, the studio's `@homie-rocks/studio` is older than
  the port toolkit: call the Homie MCP tool `game_port` for the pinned package and
  install it exactly as it says, then run `npm install`. Without the connector,
  `npx -y @homie-rocks/studio@latest upgrade` says what to change (the `studio-setup` skill, "An existing
  studio that is behind").

## 1. Read it and grade it (before changing anything)

```sh
npx --no-install homie-studio port plan <game folder>
```

The plan is a draft from reading files: engine, loop, input, camera, physics,
storage, audio, size, licence, risks, and a grade. Now read the code yourself: the
main loop, where input is read, what the state is (player, enemies, pickups, level,
score), how the camera moves, what "game over" is. Then write `PORT.md` in the game
(template: [references/PORT-TEMPLATE.md](references/PORT-TEMPLATE.md)) with:

- **the grade** — easy, medium, hard (fast physics, precise timing, huge state), or
  **not a fit** — and one paragraph of why, in plain words;
- the multiplayer design: what a round is, what the host owns, what each browser
  owns, what bots do, how a late joiner comes in, what the big screen shows;
- the rules/view boundary: server-owned entities and shared state, shared `defineMove` for
  immediate local movement, the existing renderer consuming predicted/interpolated poses;
- controls on keys and on touch, and the camera rule (below).

Tell the person the grade and why in two or three lines, then go on. If it is
**not a fit** (it needs its own server, WebAssembly threads, or its licence forbids
it), stop there and explain what would make it portable. The port toolkit is in beta:
a game that is not a fit today, or a port the checks cannot judge, is worth a port
request at https://github.com/homie-rocks/homie/issues/new/choose (the game's public
address and licence, the grade and why; no keys or private addresses).

Licence: a game you did not make must carry a licence that allows changing and
publishing it (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC...). Keep the licence file with the game.
No licence, or a licence that forbids it: port it for private testing only and say so.

## 2. Bring it into the studio

```sh
npx --no-install homie-studio port import <game folder> --id <id> [--name "<Name>"]
```

It copies the game to `games/<id>/` untouched except: the port toolkit loads first
in `<head>` (sandbox shims, first-touch audio, `window.HomiePort`) and the viewport
is phone-safe. `game.json` says how it builds: `static` (the folder as it is, for
plain `<script>` games), `bundle` (an ES-module entry bundled by esbuild), or
`command` (its own Vite/webpack build; set its base to `./`). The id is the
game's address: lowercase, digits, hyphens.

## 3. Port it

Read the game skill's [RULES.md](../game/RULES.md) and
[REWRITE.md](../game/REWRITE.md), then extract truth from the existing loop step by step.
This is a manual rewrite to rules plus view with `room.host: "server"`. Keep the art,
renderer, controls, sound and feel. `port import` only copies files; it does not convert
rules. The older `references/RECIPE.md` explains existing `createRoom` ports for maintenance,
not the architecture for a new port. Never add a browser host to get past a rules error.

Use declared entities and events for hits, scores, spawns and turns, shared `defineMove`
for local prediction, authored map data for collision, and `world.math`/the provided clocks
and random source for deterministic logic. Match the original movement before adding
multiplayer. Bots and guide floors use the same legal inputs and the world's skill policy.
Round, late arrival, watch and TV behavior must fit the actual game; keep a board game's
turns and a tank game's intentional steering. Do not silently turn it into a gem collector.

Use the rules starter's truthful `exposePort` probe; adapt its input, body and camera values
to what players actually see. Report renderer counters when available. The first browser
leaving cannot end a server-hosted room; no browser checkpoint or host election is needed.
Phone controls stay at the edges; keep the world readable upright and sideways, with an
unmistakable own player. Read [references/LESSONS.md](references/LESSONS.md) for control
and camera failures, applying their lessons to the preserved game rather than replacing it.

## 4. Prove it (and keep going until it passes)

Build first (`npm run build`); repair rules guard, types and deterministic play errors using RULES.md.
In the studio, start the site locally and run the checks. Both are long-running:
start each as a **background task your app keeps alive** (Claude Code: the Bash
tool's `run_in_background`; a `nohup ... &` inside an ordinary command can be killed
when that command returns, and a dev server that dies mid-check fails every later
row). The full check takes 3–6 minutes; poll its log with short commands.

```sh
npm run dev > .dev.log 2>&1                                                  # background task: http://127.0.0.1:8787
npx --no-install homie-studio port check <id> --url http://127.0.0.1:8787 > .port-check.log 2>&1   # background task
tail -5 .port-check.log                            # poll until it prints PASS or NOT YET
```

The check says so when the site stops answering; restart the dev server as a
background task and rerun.

`--only owner-desk,owner-phone,...` reruns single rows while you fix. Each row, what
it measures and how to fix a failure: [references/CHECKS.md](references/CHECKS.md).

- **owner-desk / owner-phone / owner-iphone**: hold a direction 5 s → one straight
  line the pressed way, camera yaw change under 10°; alternate directions for 10 s
  → every press goes the pressed way. Stationary rules declare maxSpeed 0: movement rows are N/A; explicitly test
  the actual choices, taps or turns in two browsers. Keys on a computer; real touch on Android Chrome and iPhone
  WebKit (first time: `npm i -D playwright-core@1.58.2 && npx playwright-core install webkit`).
- **ui-cover**: the UI covers at most 12% of a phone, nothing opaque in the middle.
- **round**: two fresh browsers (a computer and a phone) meet through Play and both
  see a round finish with both of them in the results.
- **host-kill / late-join**: the first player's browser is killed mid-round; the other
  continues the same server-hosted round (an unchanged older browser-hosted game elects a host); a late joiner is seated in a bot's place
  with the world and the right clock at once.
- **tv**, **audio**, **errors**: the big screen, sound after the first input, no
  uncaught errors.

Look at the screenshots in `games/<id>/.port/check-*/` yourself: is your own
body easy to find, does the world fill an upright phone, is the text readable,
does the big screen show the game? A passing check with an ugly, tiny or
confusing picture is not done. When you debug in a browser of your own, open one
at a time (the check already runs two). Fix, rebuild
(`npm run build`; the dev server serves the new files), check again. When you are
done, stop the dev server: stop it with `npx --no-install homie-studio dev --stop`, which stops exactly this studio's dev server (and its Wrangler) and nothing else. Never `pkill`, `killall` or `lsof ... | xargs kill` by name or port: other projects on this machine may run their own `wrangler dev`, and a pattern stops theirs too.

If something still fails after real effort, say exactly which row, what you saw,
and why — never hide it.

When the rows pass, the port works; whether it is good is the `playtest` skill's question: it adds a
phone held sideways, the look while playing, the UI in landscape, the game's real sound, a round with
one player trying and one idle, and a blind review by a fresh reviewer. A port that went silent or
never had sound: the `sound` skill makes and wires effects and a theme for free.

## 5. Publish when requested

A port request authorizes building and checking. If going live or listing was not
requested, hand off the checked local result; do not begin account setup or deploy.
When publication is requested, follow the `publish` skill: `npm run deploy` (the person approves Cloudflare once
if Wrangler is not signed in), then run the full check against the live site:

```sh
npx --no-install homie-studio port check <id> --url <the live site> > .port-check-live.log 2>&1   # background task
```

If a directory listing was requested, list it with the Homie MCP tool `studio_publish` { site } (without the connector,
`npx --no-install homie-studio publish`). Commit the studio
(`git add -A && git commit -m "Port <Name> to multiplayer"` inside the studio).

## 6. Tell the person

Five to eight lines: the grade and why; what multiplayer means in their game now
(rounds, bots, what the host decides); the check table (each row pass/fail, with
the numbers that matter); the local start command and paths, or the live Play/big-screen links and any
requested directory listing; and anything still weak, plainly. If something in Homie itself got in the
way, say it can be reported at https://github.com/homie-rocks/homie/issues/new/choose.

## Never

- Never skip a check or weaken it to pass; never call a failing row "fine".
- Never publish a game whose licence does not allow it.
- Never put a key, token or password in the studio or in chat.
- Never touch a Cloudflare resource the studio did not create.
- Never ask the person to run a command.
